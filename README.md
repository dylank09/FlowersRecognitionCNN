# FlowersRecognitionCNN

This is a 4th year project in Neural Computing

The task was to To implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on popular CNN architectures such as 
LeNet, AlexNet, GoogleLeNet, VGG, Inception, ResNet, Xception, SENet, FCNs, YOLO, and hybrids.

I used the Flowers collection found at the link in the pdf to train the model to detect the class of flower in an image.
